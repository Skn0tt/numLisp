# numLisp

![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/numlisp?style=flat-square)

A naÃ¯ve Lisp interpreter.
It only supports Lists and Numbers and doesn't support custom definitions.

Usage:

```sh
> yarn global add numlisp

> numlisp '(+ 10 (car (list 32 33 34)))'
42
```

## Motivation

I've created this to find out how to build an interpreter - and it's surprisingly simple, really!
Try it out for yourself before you have a look at this one, it's a lot of fun.
